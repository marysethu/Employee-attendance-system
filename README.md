🧾 Project Title:

Employee Attendance System

📘 Project Description:

The Employee Attendance System is a software application developed to automate the process of recording, managing, and monitoring employee attendance in an organization. The main objective of this system is to replace the traditional manual attendance process (such as paper registers or spreadsheets) with a digital, reliable, and efficient system that minimizes errors and saves administrative time.

This system allows employees to check in and check out using various methods such as biometric scanners, ID cards, or web/mobile applications. Each record is stored in a centralized database that can be accessed by the HR department and management for reporting and payroll purposes.

The system provides features for attendance tracking, leave management, shift scheduling, and report generation. It ensures accuracy in recording working hours, reduces time theft (like proxy attendance), and improves overall workforce discipline.

In addition, the system can generate analytical reports such as daily, weekly, and monthly attendance summaries, absenteeism trends, and overtime details, helping management make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives:

To automate the process of employee attendance recording.

To reduce manual errors and administrative workload.

To provide accurate and real-time attendance data.
